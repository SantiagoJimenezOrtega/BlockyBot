Final Project - Interactive Virtual Lab for Teaching Arrays and Functions
Author: Santiago Jiménez Ortega
Institution: Universidad Santo Tomás - Tunja Campus
Degree: Systems Engineering

Project Description
This project is an interactive virtual lab designed to teach arrays and functions in programming to first-year Systems Engineering students. Using video game development techniques, this lab provides an immersive and educational environment where students can interact with fundamental concepts in a practical and visually engaging way.

Objectives
Facilitate learning of arrays and functions through a visual and hands-on approach.
Enhance understanding of data manipulation within array structures and the execution flow of functions.
Encourage exploration and practice through interactive exercises and challenges within the game.
Features
Interactive environment: Allows students to engage with objects representing arrays and functions.
Guided examples and exercises: Includes a series of step-by-step tasks explaining the usage and handling of arrays and functions.
Real-time feedback: Provides immediate feedback for each exercise, helping students correct mistakes and improve understanding.
Achievement-based progression: Game structure allows students to progress as they complete and understand exercises, promoting progressive learning.
